    This statement assigns a name to a constant (as does the standard PARAMETER statement), but there are no parentheses surrounding the

    <# This option determines whether the compiler uses the current Fortran Standard rules or the old Fortran 2003 rules when interpreting

    allocatable object, it should be reallocated to the shape of the right-hand side of the assignment before the assignment occurs. This is
    the current Fortran Standard definition. This feature may cause extra overhead at runtime. This option has the same effect as option assume
    realloc_lhs. If you specify nostandard-realloc-lhs, the compiler uses the old Fortran 2003 rules when interpreting assignment statements.
    The left-hand side is assumed to be allocated with the correct shape to hold the right-hand side. If it is not, incorrect behavior will occur.
